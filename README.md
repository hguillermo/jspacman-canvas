jspacman - ImpactJS
=================

This is my second try writing a javascript pacman clone. This time I decided to use Impact.js which is a very nice javascript game engine (I highly recommend you to buy it. It is really worth it! http://impactjs.com/)

There are a few things to do:

1. Clean the code and add comments

2. Add the sounds

3. Fix some bugs (sometimes the ghosts get stuck)

4. Do some optimizations for 60 fps

5. Add a multiplayer feature

This game is property of Namco Bandai. I am just trying to help people who wants to write/learn how to code games.

I took a lot of ideas about the game and ghoster's AI from this web site: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php

Please read that and you will understand how amazing is the pacman game. I did my best (well...almost) to make it perfect and pretty similar to the arcade version. If you have suggestions let me know.

You can read more about the game here:
