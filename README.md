jspacman - ImpactJS
=================

This is my second try writing a javascript pacman clone. This time I decided to use Impact.js which is a very nice javascript game engine. 

There are a few things to do:

1. Clean the code and add comments

2. Add the sounds

3. Fix some bugs (sometimes the ghosts get stucked)

4. Do some optimizations

5. Add a multiplayer feature

This game is property of Namco Bandai. I am just trying to help people who wants to write/learn how to code games.

I took a lot of ideas from this web site: http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html

Please read that and you will understand how amazing is the pacman game. I did my best (well...almost) to make it perfect and pretty similar to the arcade version. If you have suggestions let me know.

You can play the game here:
